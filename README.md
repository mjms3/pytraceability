**pytraceability** is a Python library that helps you link code to requirements.
It provides a command line interface (CLI) and a Python API for tracing the relationships between code and requirements.

It defines a decorator that can be used to annotate functions, classes, and methods with traceability information,
linking back to requirements and other relevant documentation.

For further information, please refer to the documentation.
